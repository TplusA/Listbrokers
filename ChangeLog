	* Version 5.0 released.

	* D-Bus interface changes: Adapted to new D-Bus interfaces for
	  potentially long-running data retrievals.

	  Clients are supposed to send a request for some data. If these data
	  can are immediately available or can be retrieved within a very
	  short period of time, then these data are returned to the client
	  just like they were before.

	  Otherwise, a cookie (a sufficiently unique numerical ID associated
	  with the requested data) is returned to the client. When the data
	  are available, the client gets notified. Finally, the client may
	  fetch the data using the cookie.

	  All D-Bus method calls involved are designed to return immediately
	  so they can be used using synchronous D-Bus method invocations.
	  Asynchronicity is achieved and introduced by the optional
	  notification-and-fetch phase. This allows complete control over
	  timeouts without running into standard D-Bus timeouts.

	* Debugging: Time measurement for D-Bus work items so that we can
	  discover bottlenecks.

	* Misc: Fix double free bug; many improvements in code.

	* Build system: Support Meson.

	* Licensing: Changed license from GPLv3+ to GPLv2+.
